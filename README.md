## Setup & Installation

### Navigate to individual competition directories for instruction

## Notes

- The project uses relative paths for data loading, making it easy to run locally or on other platforms.
- The `download.sh` script automates dataset download and extraction from Kaggle.
- You can skip the pre-trained model download in the script if you prefer to train from scratch.
